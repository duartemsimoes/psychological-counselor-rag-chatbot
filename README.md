# psychological-counselor-rag-chatbot
AI powered chatbot that provides psychological counseling based on a book

This tool is intended for educational or personal‑use only. It does not replace professional psychological advice or therapy. If you are in crisis or need professional help — please seek a licensed mental‑health professional.

## Concept

The fundamentals of Adlerian Psychology presented in a simple, dialogue-based way in the book The Courage To Be Disliked are quite interesting and are mostly in agreement with my world view. 
​Sometimes I have questions of how to proceed or reason about certain situations and would benefit from some knowledge source to bounce my ideas against.

Taking into account the emergence of chatbots I consider it would be interesting to create a chatbot capable of answering my questions based on the knowledge of the book.

To implement this, to the best of my knowledge, RAG appeared to be a suiting approach.

This AI chatbot uses the OpenAI API in order to leverage the performance of gpt-5 models.

## An example interaction:

python query_data.py "How to find love?"             
Response: Short answer: find someone with whom you can be free and equal — someone you can trust and encourage, not control. Love is a practice built from self-knowledge, horizontal (equal) relationships, clear boundaries, and ongoing cooperation.

How that follows from the dialogue
- Adler (as the philosopher in the text) says love is not restriction. Real love lets both people act freely and feel equal.  
- “Separation of tasks” means you accept responsibility for your own feelings, belief and behaviour, and leave the other person responsible for theirs. Believing in someone is your task; how they act on that belief is their task.  
- Community feeling and encouragement: healthy relationships are cooperative and oriented toward the other’s growth, not possession or control.

Practical steps you can use right away

1. Know yourself first
- Clarify what you value, what you need from a partner, and what you will and won’t accept.  
- Practice self-encouragement: treat your ambitions and failings kindly so you don’t rely on another person to “complete” you.

2. Put yourself where you can meet people with shared interests
- Join groups, classes, volunteer projects, workplaces or hobbies that matter to you. Love often grows out of cooperation and shared tasks, not from forcing contact.

3. Practice horizontal relating
- In conversations and interactions aim for equality: ask open questions, listen, and share honestly without trying to dominate or appease.  
- Look for people who treat you as an equal and who invite your opinion and agency.

4. Learn and use separation of tasks
- Own your feelings and requests; don’t treat the other person as responsible for fixing them.  
- Leave their choices to them. Example: “I want closeness; would you like to spend this weekend together?” — you’ve expressed your task. Whether they can or will is their task.

5. Encourage more than you criticize
- Offer genuine support for the other person’s goals and efforts. Encouragement builds trust and connection; criticism builds distance.

6. Communicate boundary-and-trust language
- When you feel jealous or insecure, name it without blaming: “I’m feeling anxious about X. That’s my feeling. Can we talk about how we each see this?”  
- Ask for arrangements, not demands. Be ready to negotiate.

7. Test the relationship with small experiments
- Do ordinary things together and notice how it feels: can you act freely? Do you feel calm, respected, encouraged? If being together feels oppressive, that’s an important signal.

8. Keep developing social interest
- Love is easier to find and sustain when you’re embedded in a community and contributing to others. This reduces neediness and increases natural attraction.

9. Face problems instead of fleeing
- If a relationship becomes distressful, address it rather than avoid it. Work on problems together; if it remains harmful despite honest effort, separation may be necessary. That decision is different in romantic love (where separation is possible) than with family (where boundaries must be more carefully managed).

Concrete phrases you can try
- “I value our time together. I’d like to do X — how do you feel about that?”  
- “I’m feeling jealous/anxious; that’s my feeling. Can we talk about what each of us needs?”  
- “I want to support you. What would feel helpful from me?”  
- “I trust you, and I also need to state my boundary: I’m not comfortable with X.”

Signs of a healthy love to look for
- You can be yourself and act freely around them.  
- You feel encouraged and useful, not controlled or diminished.  
- Conflicts are negotiated as equals, not won or enforced.  
- There is mutual willingness to cooperate and contribute to each other’s life projects.

Final note
Finding love is both an outward search and an inner practice: build your life, join communities, practise equality and encouragement, and learn to separate your tasks from others’. That combination attracts and sustains the kind of calm, free relationship the dialogue describes. It’s hard work and takes time — be patient with yourself and persistent in practicing these skills.
